# new-world-status

New World server status.

## Getting started
Create a webhook on your Discord server, then set it as `WEBHOOK_URL` in your env vars.

In this state, it works only for EU Central servers, and Kaloon is used by default. To get your server status, change it in the code in `index.ts` file.
